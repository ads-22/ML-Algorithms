I learned the importance of being coachable and how trusting a coaching just open the doors of success and show the right path. One should always manage time wisely to achieve the target.
We should always know the reason why we are doing a certain thing.
Also, it's like doing the thing with full dedication or not to do it. There is nothing in midway.
